I downloaded a chinook database which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers in my SQLiteStudio and 
I came up with questions to break the database up and to also tell a story on what my queries mean to the database. 

#1
/*How many invoices were there in 2013?*/

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2013-01-01' AND '2013-12-31';

#2
/*Show the Invoice Total, customer name, country, and sales agent name for all invoices and customers.*/

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#3
/*Provide a query that shows all the tracks, and include the album name, Media type, and genre.*/

SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name', a.Title AS 'Album Title', m.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.Albums a 
on a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.Media_Types m
on m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.Genres g
on g.GenreId = t.GenreId;

#4
/*Find the invoices of customers who are from Canada. The resulting table should show the customers full name, invoice id, date of the invoice, and billing country.*/

SELECT cust.LastName, cust.FirstName, Inv.InvoiceID, Inv.BillingCountry, INV.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices AS INV
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers AS cust
ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry='Canada';

#5
/*Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").*/
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country != "USA";

#6
/*Show only the Customers from Brazil.*/
SELECT * FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = "Brazil" ;

#7
/*Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.*/
SELECT * FROM chinook.Employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent" ;

#8
/*Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.*/
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry 
FROM chinook.Invoices ;


#9
/*What are the total sales for 2013?*/

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2013-01-01' AND '2013-12-31';

#10
/*Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.*/

SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.Tracks t 
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId;

#11
/*Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.*/

SELECT ar.name as Artist, t.Name as Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON ar.ArtistID=a.ArtistID;

#12
/*Show the total sales made by each sales agent.*/
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

#13
/*Which sales agent made the most and least dollars in sales in 2009?*/

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  ASC LIMIT 1;


#14
/*How many invoices were there in 2009?*/

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';
